# Computational Empathy Ontology <This page is under construction>
This repository presents an ontology defining the concept we call "computational empathy". This regards a herarchy of sub-concepts for understanding perceptions of empathy in computational systems. In order to enable interoperability with a wide range of knowledge-based systems, the ontology is implemented in Web Ontology Language (OWL).

## Background
Empathy is a complex construct, and this ontology provides a formal representation of its facets. Rooted in a qualitative analysis using grounded theory, the ontology formalizes empathy for interactive agents. Abstract concepts enable measurement and evaluation of empathetic performance.

## Taxonomy and Dimensions

The Empathy Ontology structures concepts hierarchically. Primary dimensions include:

- Perceive
- Act
- Manifest
- Theory_of_mind
- Ratification
- Interpersonal

These encompass sub-dimensions, capturing hierarchical relationships.

## Examples and Applications

The Empathy Ontology aids researchers and practitioners in understanding, evaluating, and implementing computational empathy. It standardizes discussing and representing empathy in computational systems. The Empathy Ontology finds applications in, e.g., Human-Computer Interaction, Artificial Intelligence, virtual agents, and social robots. It assesses perceptions of empathetic capabilities, which may lead to improved interactions.
